Microsoft has recently launch its new service called [Curah](http://curah.microsoft.com) for you, IT pro, to “share your knowledge”.

Somewhere between delicious, a wiki, a share onenote workbook, it is an attempt ) by Microsoft to make you create the documentation like the [ social technet ](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki)was intended for but with limited success outside Microsoft employees.

Why not if it can bring a single point of access for interesting technical-related links

However if you look at the [terms of service](http://curah.microsoft.com/terms) before signing up,(which [everybody does](http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s15e01-humancentipad), needless to say), you’ll unhappily soon discover under the ‘content’ paragraph that all your knowledge becomes theirs.

So I’ll better stay with my self-managed wiki for the time being…
