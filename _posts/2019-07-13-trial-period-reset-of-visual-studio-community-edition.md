Although Visual Studio Community Edition is supposed to be free, you are required after 30 days by the graphical interface to have an account on Microsoftâ€™s online services to continue to use the product. The trial period reset of Visual Studio Community Edition can however be easily achieved by editing the registry.

As mentioned in this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43390466/is-visual-studio-community-a-30-day-trial/51570570#51570570), the expiration date for these 30 days are registered in a registry value protected by the CryptProtectData API. The algorithm is then

1. Get the value in HKCR\\Licenses\\5C505A59-E312-4B89-9508-E162F8150517\\08878 for VSCE 2017 or HKCR\\Licenses\\41717607-F34E-432C-A138-A3CFD7E25CDA\\09278 for VCSE 2019
2. Decrypt the value with `<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dpapi/nf-dpapi-cryptunprotectdata">CryptUnprotectData</a>`.
3. Get and change the values in bytes -16,-15 (YY), -14,-13 (MM), -12, -11 (DD)
4. Encrypt the value with `<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dpapi/nf-dpapi-cryptprotectdata">CryptProtectData</a>`.
5. Set the value back in the registry where you found it.

In Powershell, a module has been published which does this. However, the manifest was not properly edited, so you can find an [updated version](https://github.com/1Dimitri/VSCELicense/) with the following changes:

1. CompatiblePSEditions is valid for Powershell 5.1 or higher
2. The RequiredAssemblies to load, in this case System.Security for the Cryptography functions, directive takes an array of strings, not a simple string

If you want a ready-to-use solution, i.e. a MSI Installer which installs the module without the need for an internet connection and a scheduled task to periodically reset the period, just go to the[github repo for this project](https://github.com/1Dimitri/VSCELicense/tags).
