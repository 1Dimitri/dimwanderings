Sometimes you find gems into documentation that is not directly related to what you expect to find there.

The [SQL Server 2008 Compliance guide](http://r.duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2Fb%2Fe%2F6%2Fbe6f02af-882e-4039-b737-8741e0c1b342%2FReachingCompliance.docx) is quite old by now but is still filled with lots of good stuff, including a simple definition of the difference of the following three terms:

- risk management is knowing what risks you are taking with the data
- governance means the actions you are doing to prevent, or at least, mitigate those risks
- compliance is the control, or double-check that this governance stuff is really performed
