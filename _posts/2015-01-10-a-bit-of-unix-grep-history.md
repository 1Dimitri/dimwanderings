An interesting story telling about why the unix grep command is named that way can be found [here](https://medium.com/@rualthanzauva/grep-was-a-private-command-of-mine-for-quite-a-while-before-i-made-it-public-ken-thompson-a40e24a5ef48).

In addition to author Ken Thompson, special guest star Alfred Aho is also mentioned for his works on egrep and fgrep.
